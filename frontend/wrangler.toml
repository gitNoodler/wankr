# Production wankrbot.com uses Cloudflare Tunnel to your Node backend (full-stack), not this Worker.
# Do NOT add wankrbot.com here — keep it on the tunnel or you get 405 on /api.
# See BRING_ONLINE.md and docs/CLOUDFLARE_TUNNEL_SETUP.md.
# Deploying this Worker only publishes to *.workers.dev (e.g. wankr.<account>.workers.dev) for testing.
